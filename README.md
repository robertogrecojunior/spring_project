# Highly Available, Auto-Scaling Infrastructure for a Stateless Web Application with Stateful Backend

## Overview

The objective is to build a highly available, auto-scaling infrastructure for a stateless web application with a stateful backend. The infrastructure ensures reliability, scalability, and fault tolerance by using core AWS services and Kubernetes for orchestration.

## Core Components

- **Load Balancer (LB)**: Distributes traffic across multiple instances, ensuring high availability.
- **Auto-Scaling Group (ASG)**: Dynamically scales the number of instances based on traffic load.
- **Stateless Web Application Layer**: Web servers handling requests without maintaining session state.
- **Stateful Backend**: A persistent database or storage for user data and other stateful resources.
- **Monitoring**: Tools like AWS CloudWatch for performance tracking and alerts.

## Infrastructure Design

### 1. Load Balancer
- **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)**: Routes traffic across instances in multiple availability zones.
- **Health Checks**: Monitors the health of instances to ensure traffic is only routed to healthy ones.

### 2. Auto-Scaling Group (ASG)
- **Auto-Scaling Policies**:
  - Scale-Out: Adds instances when CPU or traffic exceeds a threshold.
  - Scale-In: Reduces instances when demand drops.
- **Multi-AZ Deployment**: Instances are distributed across multiple availability zones for fault tolerance.

### 3. Stateless Web Application Layer
- **EC2 Instances or Containers**: Stateless instances that handle requests without session data. For session management, use distributed stores like Redis or Memcached.

### 4. Stateful Backend
- **Database (RDBMS or NoSQL)**: Managed services like Amazon RDS or DynamoDB with multi-AZ replication.
- **Object Storage**: Services like S3 for file storage.
- **Backups**: Enable automatic backups and cross-AZ replication for data durability.

### 5. VPC and Networking
- **Public/Private Subnets**: Isolate public-facing components (e.g., load balancer) from private resources (e.g., databases).
- **NAT Gateway**: For private instances to access external resources securely.
