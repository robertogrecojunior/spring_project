# Deploying Containerized Microservices on Kubernetes using Helm and GitOps

This project demonstrates how to deploy containerized microservices on a Kubernetes cluster using Helm for deployment and GitOps for automated version-controlled deployments.

## Core Components
- **Kubernetes Cluster**: Hosts the microservices.
- **Helm**: Manages Kubernetes resources as charts for microservice deployment.
- **GitOps**: Automates deployment via Git repository, using tools like Flux or ArgoCD.

## Steps
1. Build microservices and store their images in a container registry.
2. Create Helm charts to define Kubernetes resources (Deployment, Service, Ingress).
3. Set up GitOps using a tool like Flux or ArgoCD to monitor and sync the Git repository to the Kubernetes cluster.
4. Deploy the Helm charts and automate updates using GitOps.

## Benefits
- **Helm** simplifies upgrades and rollbacks.
- **GitOps** ensures continuous deployment, syncs cluster state with Git, and provides version control.
