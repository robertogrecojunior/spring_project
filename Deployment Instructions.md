## Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Setting Up the Load Balancer

1. **Create a Load Balancer (ELB or ALB)**:
   - Configure it to route traffic across instances in multiple availability zones.
   - Set up **health checks** to monitor the instances and route traffic only to healthy ones.

### Step 2: Configuring Auto-Scaling

1. **Set up Auto-Scaling Group**:
   - Define policies for **Scale-Out** (add instances) when traffic increases and **Scale-In** (remove instances) when demand decreases.
   - Distribute instances across multiple availability zones for fault tolerance.

### Step 3: Deploying the Stateless Web Application

1. **Deploy EC2 Instances or Containers**:
   - Deploy your stateless web application using **EC2** or **Docker containers**.
   - For containerized applications, consider using **Kubernetes** to orchestrate the deployment and ensure auto-scaling.

### Step 4: Setting Up the Stateful Backend

1. **Deploy a Database**:
   - Use a managed database service such as **RDS**, **DynamoDB**, or **Azure SQL**.
   - Enable **multi-AZ replication** for high availability and fault tolerance.

2. **Set up Object Storage**:
   - Configure **Amazon S3** or **Azure Blob Storage** to handle persistent file storage.
   - Enable **automatic backups** for disaster recovery.

### Step 5: Configuring VPC and Networking

1. **Configure Public and Private Subnets**:
   - Public subnets for the load balancer and NAT gateway.
   - Private subnets for backend services (e.g., databases, app servers).

2. **Set up a NAT Gateway**:
   - Ensure instances in private subnets can securely access external resources.

### Step 6: Security and Monitoring

1. **Configure Security Groups**:
   - Set rules to allow only necessary traffic (e.g., HTTP/HTTPS on port 80/443) to web servers.
   - Limit access to databases to only specific instances in private subnets.

2. **Set up Monitoring and Alerts**:
   - Use **CloudWatch** or **Azure Monitor** to track instance performance (e.g., CPU, memory, disk usage).
   - Configure alerts for scaling events, instance failures, or abnormal traffic patterns.
